## Gumption traps

https://medium.com/thrive-global/gumption-traps-d20ec36d4f48

Many things can be a gumption trap; a bad work environment, disrespectful coworkers, cheap tools, self doubt, an accident or an unsuccessful first try. The key is to recognize that gumption is not a fixed commodity. At times you are full of faith. At others you need a break. Sometimes you need to shift your focus from the task at hand to your own state of consciousness in order to be effective. Awareness of this dynamic empowers you to use your energy more wisely and frees you from beating yourself up unnecessarily for not being 100% at all times and in all circumstances. Learning to recognize gumption traps will help you to avoid them at times, but more important is acknowledging them when they do arise and adjusting accordingly. Doing so can save you immense effort and may be the thing that allows you to finish what would otherwise have become an aborted project. One of my favorite gumption refills is a nap :)
